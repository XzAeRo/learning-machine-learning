# Learning Machine Learning

This repository contains my personal effort to learn (and practice), about artificial intelligence and machine learning.

The majority of this scripts are created based on online tutorials, which are credited at the top of each file.

## Running the scripts

1. Install Python 3+ and [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv).
2. Download and navigate to the root of this repository in your console.
2. Run: `pipenv install`
3. Enter the virtualenv by running `pipenv shell`
4. Load your preferred code editor from the same console, eg: Visual Studio Code `code .`. Otherwise your linters will go crazy.
4. Now just run any script! Eg: `python 00-intro/00-intro.py`
5. Enjoy and read the comments I left in the code.
